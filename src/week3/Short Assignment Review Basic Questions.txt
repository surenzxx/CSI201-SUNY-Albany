Program 1: HelloWorld.java

1) Describe what happens if in the code above, you omit:

a. If you remove "public" the code won't run.
b. If you remove "static" the code won't run.
c. If you remove "void" the code won't run.
d. If you remove "args" the code won't run.

2) Describe what happens in code above, you misspell (by, say, omitting the second letter):

a. If you mispell "public" the code won't run.
b. If you mispell "static" the code won't run.
c. If you mispell "void" the code won't run.
d. If you mispell "args" the code won't run.

3) What is System.out.println("Hello, World");
c. Method call.

The program will not run. There is a missing "String[] args" on the second line of the code.

The program will not run. The "public static void main(String [] args)" line is entirely missing. StdDraw.filleCircle(0.5,0.5,0.1) is a method call.

The program will run. It draws a filled circle close to the X axis farther on the Y axis. If you change the function to be StdDraw.filleCircle(0.6, 0.3, 0.1) then the circle is farther on the x-axis and closer on the y-axis.

a, b, and t are integers.
The first line declares 1 to be the value of a variable a, which is an integer type.
The second line declares 4 to be the value of a variable b, which is also an integer type.
The third line declares the value of variable a to a new integer type variable t. 
The fourth line sets the value of the t variable to the b variable.
The fifth line sets the value of the variable b to the a variable.
The program prints out one three times.

a and b are int values, simplify: (!(a < b) && !(a > b)); (a ==b)

System.out.println(15/6); will print 2. This is because it's store as an integer not a double.

A. 2bc
B. 5bc
C. 5bc
D. bc5
E. bc23

E. double force = (G * mass1 * mass2) / (r * r);

N is 0
M is 987654321

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610

The program will not run, the variable sum is not defined. If you want it to work you need to declare int outside of the while loop first.

If the value of "x" is greater than 0 it prints "positive"
 
The code doesn't run because it's missing the curly braces.

The program prints all the even numbers between 1 and 10 but prints 1 by mistake.
